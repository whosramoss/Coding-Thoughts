# What is Matlab?

- ➡️ MATLAB is a programming language appropriate for the development of technical applications. As its name suggests, MATLAB is well suited for those who want to implement and test solutions easily and accurately (like in a lab!), Without wasting time with specific programming language details. For this, it has facilities for computing, visualization and programming, within a friendly and easy to learn environment.

- ➡️The name MATLAB comes from Matrix Laboratory. MATLAB was originally developed to provide user-friendly access to vector and matrix handling. As you will see below, the basic elements of the language are exactly the vectors and matrices. For this reason it is important that these elements and their operations are well understood to get the best from MATLAB.

- ➡️Today MATLAB has a very comprehensive library of mathematical functions, graphing, and data manipulation that greatly aid the programmer's work. It also has a vast collection of libraries - called toolboxes - for specific areas such as ordinary differential equations, EDP, statistics, image processing, signal processing, finance.

- ➡️The MATLAB programming language and environment also allows the user to write their own MATLAB libraries. Thus, the user can enrich the language by incorporating new functions into it.
